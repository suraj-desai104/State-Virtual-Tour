    Historical:`The Maratha Empire was one of the most powerful Indian empires, founded by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in 1674. Shivaji, a brilliant military strategist, introduced guerrilla warfare tactics (Ganimi Kava) and built a strong navy to protect the western coast of India. He established Swarajya (self-rule) and was crowned as the first Chhatrapati at Raigad Fort. After his death in 1680, his son Sambhaji Maharaj took over but was captured and executed by Aurangzeb in 1689. However, the Marathas continued to fight under Rajaram Maharaj and Maharani Tarabai, who resisted Mughal rule through guerrilla warfare.

In the early 18th century, Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj appointed Balaji Vishwanath as Peshwa (Prime Minister), shifting administrative power to the Peshwas. Under Baji Rao I, the Maratha Empire expanded rapidly, controlling Delhi, Punjab, Gujarat, Orissa, and Tamil Nadu. By 1758, the Marathas were the dominant power in India. However, their rise was halted in 1761 at the Third Battle of Panipat, where they suffered a heavy defeat against Ahmad Shah Abdali. Despite this setback, Madhavrao I revived the empire, restoring Maratha rule in North India.

By the late 18th century, the Marathas came into conflict with the British, leading to the Anglo-Maratha Wars (1775–1818). The first war ended in a Maratha victory, but in the second and third wars, the British gained control over their territories. In 1818, the last Peshwa, Bajirao II, surrendered, marking the end of the Maratha Empire. Despite its fall, the Maratha legacy remained strong, inspiring future Indian freedom fighters. Their contributions to military strategy, administration, and self-rule remain a crucial part of Indian history.`
